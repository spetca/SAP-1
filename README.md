# SAP-1

SAP-1 Implementation from the book [Digital Computer Electronics by Albert Malvino](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Computer-Electronics-Albert-Malvino/dp/0028005945)

## Notes 
- testbenches in `test/` are mostly for visual checks at the moment. Not actually asserting pass/fails.
- instruction RAM is magic ram at the moment, contents immediately available when address changes.
